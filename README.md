# Django Linker

This site is just for leveling up Django skills and probably
won't be interesting to travelers who randomly opened it but I will try my best to explain what is going on here.
The idea was proposed by my good buddie Final and all what this site
does is just opening a bunch of specified links in one click.
On first launch site generates UUID for you and uses it later on.
If you want to have same UUID on for example phone and PC, you can use import function.
